# JBS London Forms - Local Storage Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to implement local storage functionality for a forms-based application that allows users to create PPM (Planned Preventive Maintenance) surveys and cost estimates. The goal is to enable offline functionality where users can:

1. Fill out building information
2. Add multiple mechanical systems with detailed information
3. Add multiple electrical systems with detailed information  
4. Add multiple compliance and other systems
5. Fill out PPM costing summary
6. Save all data to browser's local storage for offline use
7. Later sync data when internet connection is restored (future phase)

The application needs to work offline after being cached, allowing users to work without an internet connection and save their progress locally.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Application Architecture Analysis

**Main Page Structure (`src/app/page.tsx`):**
- Single page application with all sections rendered together
- Components: BuildingInformation, MechanicalSystems, ElectricalSystems, ComplianceOtherSystems, PpmCostingSummary
- Has a "Save" button at the bottom, but currently not functional
- No state management currently implemented

**Building Information (`src/components/buildingInformation/buildingInformation.tsx`):**
- Simple form with 6 input fields:
  - Site Name, Address, Surveyed By, Client Contact, Building Type, Building Size
- No state management - inputs are uncontrolled
- Needs to be converted to controlled components for local storage

**System Forms Architecture:**
- Each system type (mechanical, electrical, compliance) has dedicated form pages
- Navigate to separate pages for adding systems: `/mechanical-system-form`, `/electrical-system-form`, `/compliance-other-systems-forms`
- Each form has system selection via combobox and detailed input fields

**Mechanical Systems (`src/app/mechanical-system-form/page.tsx`):**
- System selection from predefined list (Boiler, Chillers/AC, AHUs, etc.)
- When system selected, shows input fields: Quantity, Location, Condition, Manufacturer, Model, Service Interval, Notes
- No save functionality currently - data is lost on navigation

**Electrical Systems (`src/app/electrical-system-form/page.tsx`):**
- Similar structure to mechanical systems
- Different predefined system types (Distribution boards, lighting, power, fire alarm, etc.)
- Same input fields as mechanical systems
- No save functionality currently

**Compliance Systems (`src/app/compliance-other-systems-forms/page.tsx`):**
- System selection from compliance-specific list (Fire alarm certificates, gas safety, EICR, etc.)
- **ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** This form only shows system selection combobox, but missing the input fields that mechanical and electrical forms have

**PPM Costing Summary (`src/components/ppmCostingSummary/ppmCostingSummary.tsx`):**
- Form with 7 fields: Task/Asset, Frequency, Labour Hours, Materials, Subcontract, Total Cost, Notes & Recommendations
- No state management - inputs are uncontrolled

**System Cards (`src/components/ui/systemCard/systemCard.tsx`):**
- Currently just displays a title
- Only mechanical systems page shows a system card
- Electrical and compliance pages don't show system cards
- Need to be enhanced to display added systems dynamically

### Core Technical Challenges

1. **State Management:** No centralized state management exists - need to implement React state or context
2. **Data Persistence:** No local storage implementation exists
3. **Form Data Structure:** Need to define comprehensive data structures for all form types
4. **Navigation State Loss:** Currently when navigating between form pages, data is lost
5. **Incomplete Form Implementation:** Compliance form is missing input fields
6. **System Display:** System cards not dynamically populated with added systems

### Offline Functionality Assessment

**Your offline approach is CORRECT and will work:**
- Caching the application for offline use ‚úÖ
- Storing form data in local storage ‚úÖ  
- Working without internet connection ‚úÖ
- Syncing when connection restored (future) ‚úÖ

**Technical Requirements for Offline:**
- Service Worker for caching app files
- Local Storage for form data persistence
- Progressive Web App (PWA) configuration
- Proper state management to handle offline data

## Current Status Analysis (Updated - Post Codebase Review)

### ‚úÖ **CRITICAL RUNTIME ERROR - RESOLVED!**

**Previous Runtime Error in Layout:**
- ~~`FormProvider` component resolving to `undefined` in `RootLayout`~~
- ~~Error: "Element type is invalid: expected a string or class/function but got: undefined"~~
- **‚úÖ FIXED:** Incorrect relative import path - changed `"../../contexts/FormProvider"` to `"../contexts/FormProvider"`
- **‚úÖ Application now starts successfully with HTTP 200 response**

### ‚úÖ **What's Been Implemented (EXCELLENT Foundation Complete):**
1. **‚úÖ Complete State Management System** - React Context with useReducer pattern fully functional
2. **‚úÖ Comprehensive Type Definitions** - All interfaces for BuildingInfo, SystemBase, MechanicalSystem, ElectricalSystem, ComplianceSystem, PPMSummary, FormState
3. **‚úÖ Local Storage Integration** - saveToLocalStorage(), loadFromLocalStorage(), clearForm() with auto-save (2-second debounce)
4. **‚úÖ Enhanced Compliance Form** - Has proper compliance-specific fields (complianceStatus, lastInspectionDate, notes)
5. **‚úÖ Dependencies Installed** - uuid package ready for unique IDs
6. **‚úÖ Input Component Analysis** - Uses React.ComponentProps<"input"> so supports value/onChange props

### üîÑ **CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED - UI NOT CONNECTED TO CONTEXT:**

**üö® ROOT ISSUE:** All form components are using **uncontrolled inputs** and are **not connected to the FormContext**

**IMMEDIATE BLOCKING ISSUES:**
1. **Building Information Form** - 6 Input components with no value/onChange props
2. **PPM Costing Summary Form** - 7 Input/Textarea components with no value/onChange props  
3. **Main Page Save Button** - Exists but has no onClick handler
4. **System Forms Missing Save Logic** - Forms collect data but don't call add[System]System() functions
5. **System Forms Missing Save Buttons** - No way to submit and save system data
6. **No System Display** - Added systems don't appear in main sections (no SystemCard rendering)

**CONFIRMED WORKING:**
- FormProvider properly wrapping application in layout.tsx
- Context state management ready to receive form data  
- Local storage persistence working (tested via context functions)
- Main page navigation flow working ("Add System" buttons navigate to forms)

**CURRENT SYSTEM FORMS STATE:**
- ‚úÖ Forms exist with correct inputs (mechanical: 7 inputs, electrical: 7 inputs, compliance: 3 inputs)
- ‚úÖ System selection via combobox working
- ‚ùå **NO SAVE FUNCTIONALITY** - forms collect data but can't save to context
- ‚ùå **NO CONTEXT CONNECTION** - all inputs are uncontrolled
- ‚ùå Added systems don't appear on main page sections

üéâ **PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE + ENHANCED - ALL REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED!**

**EXECUTOR CLEARANCE:** üéâ **PROJECT COMPLETED + ENHANCED SUCCESSFULLY!**
All core tasks completed PLUS user experience enhancements! The entire user workflow is now functional with local storage persistence AND dynamic system cards. Users can fill forms, add systems, see their added systems displayed beautifully on the main page, and save everything to localStorage for offline use.

### **Technical Notes for Implementation:**
- The foundation is SOLID - all the hard architectural work is done
- Now it's about connecting UI components to the existing context

**TWO DIFFERENT FORM PATTERNS:**
1. **Building Info / PPM Summary:** Direct state updates with controlled inputs
   - Uses `useFormContext()` + `value={state.field}` + `onChange={(e) => updateField({field: e.target.value})}`
2. **System Forms:** Local form state + Save to add new objects  
   - Uses `useState()` for form + `useFormContext()` for save + `addMechanicalSystem(formData)` on Save

- System forms need save handlers that call `addMechanicalSystem()`, etc.
- Main sections need to display `state.mechanicalSystems`, `state.electricalSystems`, etc.

### **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GOTCHAS TO AVOID:**

**1. Input Component Enhancement Required:**
- Current `Input` component doesn't support `value` and `onChange` props
- Must add these props before connecting to context
- Handle number inputs specially (buildingSize, labourHours, totalCost)

**2. Data Type Compatibility:**
- Compliance systems have DIFFERENT fields than mechanical/electrical systems
- Compliance: `complianceStatus`, `lastInspectionDate`, `notes`
- Mechanical/Electrical: `quantity`, `location`, `condition`, `manufacturer`, `model`, `serviceInterval`, `notes`
- Don't try to force them into the same form structure

**3. Form Titles Need Correction:**
- Electrical form title says "Mechanical System Form" (line 39 in electrical-system-form/page.tsx)
- Compliance form title says "Mechanical System Form" (line 37 in compliance-other-systems-forms/page.tsx)

**4. Auto-save Timing:**
- Auto-save triggers after 2 seconds of changes
- During form connection, this might save incomplete data
- Consider temporarily disabling auto-save while connecting forms

**5. Number Input Handling:**
- `buildingSize`, `labourHours`, `totalCost` need special number conversion
- Use `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()` when updating context
- Handle empty string to 0 conversion

**6. System Form Save Flow:**
- Each system form needs a "Save" button (currently missing)
- After save, should navigate back to main page
- Should show confirmation of successful save

### **RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (Prevents Mess/Errors):**

**Step 1: Fix Input Component First**
```typescript
// Add to src/components/input.tsx
interface InputProps {
  type: string;
  placeholder: string;
  value?: string | number;
  onChange?: (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

**Step 2: Start with Building Information (Simplest)**
- 6 inputs, straightforward mapping to context
- Test save/load functionality works
- Verify auto-save triggers correctly

**Step 3: PPM Costing Summary**
- 7 inputs, includes number types
- Test number conversion logic
- Verify all data persists

**Step 4: Connect Save Button**
- Wire to `saveToLocalStorage()` from context
- Add visual feedback (disabled state, loading state)

**Step 5: One System Form at a Time**
- Start with Mechanical (has working input fields)
- Add save button and navigation
- Test system appears in context state

**Step 6: Display Added Systems**
- Update main sections to show added systems
- Test dynamic rendering

**Step 7: Electrical and Compliance Forms**
- Fix form titles first
- Follow same pattern as Mechanical

**Step 8: Edit/Delete (Final)**
- URL parameters for editing
- Delete confirmation

### **Testing Strategy:**
- Test each step immediately after implementation
- Check browser localStorage manually
- Verify auto-save works (check console logs)
- Test page refresh restores data

## Lessons

### Critical Runtime Errors
1. **FormProvider Import Resolution Error:** Component resolves to `undefined` at runtime despite correct syntax
   - **Symptoms:** "Element type is invalid: expected a string or class/function but got: undefined" 
   - **Root Cause:** Incorrect relative import path (`../../contexts/FormProvider` instead of `../contexts/FormProvider`)
   - **Solution:** Fix relative import path based on actual file structure
   - **Lesson:** Always double-check relative paths when converting from @ aliases to relative imports
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Application now loads successfully

### Discovered Issues During Analysis
1. **Incomplete Form Implementation:** Compliance form missing input fields that other system forms have
2. **No State Management:** All inputs are uncontrolled, losing data on navigation
3. **Missing System Display:** Only mechanical systems show system cards, others don't
4. **Non-functional Save Button:** Save button exists but has no functionality

### Technical Recommendations
1. **State Management:** Recommend React Context for this application size (could scale to Zustand if needed)
2. **Local Storage Strategy:** Store complete form state as JSON, implement versioning for future compatibility
3. **Data Structure:** Use consistent interfaces across all system types for easier management
4. **Offline Implementation:** Standard PWA approach with Service Worker will work perfectly for the described use case
5. **Import Strategy:** Be cautious with TypeScript @ aliases in Next.js - consider relative imports for critical components

## üéâ **PHASE 5 COMPLETE - FULL OFFLINE CAPABILITY ACHIEVED!**

### **‚úÖ WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED:**

**üöÄ COMPLETE OFFLINE-FIRST PWA APPLICATION:**
1. **Service Worker Caching:** All static assets, pages, and resources cached automatically

## New Feature Plan: Offline Photo Uploads per System (Planner Mode)

### Background and Motivation

Users need to attach photos to each system entry (mechanical, electrical, compliance) while fully offline, with smooth capture on mobile and desktop and efficient storage to avoid bloating localStorage and service-worker caches. Photos should be available for review in the app, persist across sessions, and be ready for future sync.

### Key Challenges and Analysis

- Efficient local persistence: Binary images must NOT go to localStorage (stringified base64 is large). Primary storage in IndexedDB; optionally use OPFS (Origin Private File System) where available for large blobs, with graceful fallback to IndexedDB for Safari/iOS.
- Cross-device capture UX: Use the native file input with camera capture on mobile (`<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">`) so it works across iOS/Android/desktop.
- Data model design: Keep large data out of the React context/localStorage; store only lightweight metadata and image IDs on each system. Include a content hash for deduplication.
- Performance: Prefer AVIF encoding when available (smaller files), gracefully fall back to WebP or PNG; generate a small thumbnail for lists; lazy-load full images on demand. Run compression in a Web Worker when supported to keep the UI responsive; fall back to main thread if bundling constraints apply.
- Quota and reliability: Handle QuotaExceededError, show storage usage, enable deletion. Request persistent storage (`navigator.storage.persist()`) to reduce eviction risk and use `navigator.storage.estimate()` to enforce limits.
- PWA/offline: All flows must work offline (no network). Service worker config should not cache large user-generated blobs; keep them exclusively in IDB/OPFS.

### Design Overview

1) Storage layer (abstracted: OPFS or IndexedDB)
- Primary: feature-detect OPFS (Chromium). If available, store full-size images as files under an app-private directory and persist file handles in metadata. Fallback: IndexedDB on Safari/iOS and any browser without OPFS.
- Always keep thumbnails in IndexedDB for fast list rendering (small, cheap to fetch and decode).
- Helper module: `src/lib/mediaStore.ts` exposing a unified API with pluggable backend (OPFS/IDB):
  - `saveImage(fileOrBlob): Promise<{ imageId, meta }>`
  - `getImageBlob(imageId): Promise<Blob | null>`
  - `getThumbBlob(imageId): Promise<Blob | null>`
  - `deleteImage(imageId): Promise<void>` (removes original and thumbnail)
  - `estimateUsage(): Promise<{ usedBytes, quotaBytes? }>`
  - Internally computes `contentHash` (SHA-256) to deduplicate images across systems.

2) Image processing (worker-backed, with graceful fallback)
- Prefer encoding to AVIF for best compression; gracefully fall back to WebP; final fallback PNG if encoder unsupported.
- Max dimension: 1600px for originals; Thumbnail max dimension: 256px.
- Strip EXIF/metadata by re-encoding.
- Run processing in a Web Worker when supported (`src/workers/imageWorker.ts`) using Canvas/OffscreenCanvas and `createImageBitmap`. If worker bundling is constrained, fall back to main-thread processing (same API).

3) Data model changes (lightweight in FormState)
- Add `PhotoMeta` type: `{ id: string; fileName: string; sizeBytes: number; mimeType: string; width: number; height: number; createdAt: string; contentHash: string }`.
- Extend `SystemBase` with `photos: PhotoMeta[]` (IDs and metadata only; no blobs or file paths in state/localStorage).
- Keep FormState in localStorage unchanged except for these small arrays.

4) Context actions
- Add generic photo actions to avoid duplication:
  - `ADD_SYSTEM_PHOTO` payload: `{ systemKind: 'mechanical' | 'electrical' | 'compliance'; systemId: string; photo: PhotoMeta }`
  - `REMOVE_SYSTEM_PHOTO` payload: `{ systemKind: ..., systemId: string; photoId: string }`
- Reducer updates the appropriate system list by ID.

5) UI components
- `PhotoUploader` component:
  - Native input: `type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment" multiple`.
  - On select: compress (worker when available), generate thumb, deduplicate by `contentHash`, store via `mediaStore`, dispatch ADD_SYSTEM_PHOTO with returned meta.
  - Show thumbnails, per-file progress, storage usage.
- `PhotoGallery` component:
  - Displays thumbnails for a system; clicking opens full image in a dialog using object URLs (`URL.createObjectURL(blob)`), with revoke on unmount.
  - Supports delete with confirmation; on delete also removes from media storage and dispatches REMOVE_SYSTEM_PHOTO.

6) Integration points
- System creation forms:
  - Optional: stage photos while editing a new system; on save, include `photos` so the reducer preserves them with the generated system ID.
- MVP (faster): enable photo uploads from the system list/card after the system exists.
- System cards (`SystemCard`): show photo count and a quick-access gallery.

7) Offline/PWA considerations
- No network required; all operations use IDB/OPFS and in-memory object URLs.
- Do not add user-generated photos to service worker HTTP caches; they live only in IDB/OPFS, so existing next-pwa config remains valid.
- Ensure routes remain functional offline as already implemented (router fixes already in place).

### High-level Task Breakdown (with Success Criteria)

Phase A: Foundations
- [ ] A1. Define `PhotoMeta` type and extend `SystemBase` with `photos: PhotoMeta[]`
  - Success: TypeScript compiles; existing app unchanged; systems can hold empty `photos` arrays.
- [ ] A2. Add context actions and reducer cases for add/remove system photos
  - Success: Dispatching add/remove updates the correct system‚Äôs `photos` array.
- [ ] A3. Storage backend detection and abstraction
  - Success: `mediaStore` chooses OPFS on Chromium and IndexedDB elsewhere; same API surface.

Phase B: Storage Layer
- [ ] B1. Implement `src/lib/mediaStore.ts` (OPFS+IDB backends, add/get/delete, usage, dedup by content hash)
  - Success: Unit tests pass with `fake-indexeddb` for IDB; OPFS code path feature-detected in browser.
- [ ] B2. Implement image processing utility `src/lib/imageUtils.ts` (encode AVIF‚ÜíWebP‚ÜíPNG; thumbnail; EXIF strip)
  - Success: Given an input File, returns compressed Blob + thumbnail with expected max dimensions and mime types.
- [ ] B3. Optional: Worker wrapper `src/workers/imageWorker.ts` with graceful main-thread fallback
  - Success: Worker path used when available; UI remains responsive on large images.

Phase C: UI Components
- [ ] C1. Create `PhotoUploader` with native file input and progress
  - Success: Selecting images saves via `mediaStore` and returns `PhotoMeta`; multiple selection supported; errors surfaced.
- [ ] C2. Create `PhotoGallery` with thumbnail grid and full-screen viewer
  - Success: Thumbnails render quickly; full image opens; memory cleaned by revoking object URLs; delete works.

Phase D: Integrations
- [ ] D1. Add `PhotoGallery` and `PhotoUploader` to Mechanical systems (card-level first)
  - Success: Can add/remove photos to an existing mechanical system; persists across reloads offline.
- [ ] D2. Repeat for Electrical systems
  - Success: Same behavior for electrical.
- [ ] D3. Repeat for Compliance systems
  - Success: Same behavior for compliance.
- [ ] D4. (Optional) In-form staging: allow adding photos while creating a new system entry
  - Success: Photos added before save appear on the newly created system after save.

Phase E: UX, Limits, and Safety
- [ ] E1. Add size/quantity limits (default: max 10 photos/system, max ~15MB/system)
  - Success: Attempts beyond limits show friendly messages; uploads prevented.
- [ ] E2. Add storage usage indicator and quota handling (`navigator.storage.estimate`, `persist()`)
  - Success: Usage bar visible; on QuotaExceededError, user sees clear guidance to delete photos.
- [ ] E3. Deduplication via `contentHash`
  - Success: Identical images are not stored twice; UI shows message when duplicates are skipped.

Phase F: Testing and Docs
- [ ] F1. Unit tests for `mediaStore` and `imageUtils` using `jest` + `fake-indexeddb`
  - Success: CI/local test run green; core functions covered.
- [ ] F2. Manual test checklist across devices (iOS/Android/desktop)
  - Success: Camera capture opens on mobile; gallery/file picker works on desktop; fully offline.

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests (for when we switch to Executor mode)

- Confirm whether MVP should allow uploads only after a system exists (card-level) first, then add in-form staging, to speed delivery.
- Confirm preferred compression targets: 1600px max; AVIF quality ~0.6‚Äì0.8; thumbnail 256px.
- Confirm limits per system (default: 10 photos/system, max ~15MB/system).
- Confirm whether to include an optional Squoosh/wasm encoder or stay with Canvas-only encoders for initial version (smaller bundle, broader compatibility).

### Lessons (anticipated)

- Keep images out of localStorage; use OPFS where available and IndexedDB otherwise; keep only metadata in context/localStorage.
- Strip EXIF to reduce size and avoid leaking location data from camera captures.
- Use worker-based processing when supported to keep UI responsive; always provide a main-thread fallback to ensure compatibility.
